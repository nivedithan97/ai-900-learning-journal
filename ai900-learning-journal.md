# My AI-900 Journey: Notes, Reflections, and Getting Started with Azure

I recently completed the **Microsoft AI-900: Azure AI Fundamentals** certification — and it’s been an exciting milestone in my learning journey! 🎉  

This was actually my **first hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure**, and I wanted to share my thoughts, lessons, and personal notes for anyone else who’s just starting out.

## 🌟 Why I Took the Exam

As someone interested in the intersection of **data, analytics, and AI**, I wanted to gain a clearer understanding of how cloud platforms like Azure make AI accessible.  
AI-900 felt like the perfect starting point, it doesn’t require deep coding or AI expertise, but it provides a solid foundation in **core AI concepts**, **machine learning basics**, and **Azure AI services**.

I also wanted to validate my understanding through a recognized certification, while building confidence to explore Azure further.

## 🧭 Preparation Path

Since this was my first time exploring Azure, I started with **Microsoft Learn’s AI-900 modules**, which I highly recommend for beginners.  

My prep plan looked something like this:
- **Microsoft Learn** → Followed the full *AI Fundamentals* learning path.  
- **YouTube tutorials** → I personally found John Savill's youtube videos for AI- 900 extremely helpful for consolidating whatever I've learnt from Microsoft Learn.
- **Practice tests** → I found the Udemy Practice tests really helpful. I also highly recommend attempting the free exam offered by Microsoft to get a feel of how the exam questions would be like.
- **My own notes** → Summarized everything into visual notes (linked below 👇).

I spent around **2–3 weeks**, studying a bit evening, focusing more on understanding *concepts* than memorizing definitions. Putting it in a mindmap really helped affirm my understanding.

## 📒 My Notes

I created a concise visual summary of all key topics in Canva — including AI principles, responsible AI, ML workflows, and Azure Cognitive Services.

These notes helped me retain the big ideas and understand how each Azure service fits into real-world AI solutions.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

Here are some of my main learnings:
- **AI on Azure is more approachable than I expected** — tools like Cognitive Services abstract away a lot of complexity.
- **Responsible AI** isn’t just a buzzword — it’s embedded in how Microsoft designs and governs its AI solutions.
- Understanding **use cases** is just as important as learning the services themselves.
- The **exam is conceptual**, not deeply technical, but you should know what each Azure AI service does and when to use it.

## 🧠 Exam Day & Experience

The exam itself was quite straightforward if you’ve gone through the Microsoft Learn materials.  

There were a few scenario-based questions asking which service you’d use in a particular situation (e.g., Computer Vision vs Custom Vision).  
Time wasn’t an issue — I finished early and had time to review.  

My advice:
- Read questions carefully — some answers are *very similar*.  
- Don’t overthink it — focus on the **purpose** of each service.  
- Stay calm! It’s an entry-level exam designed for newcomers.

## 🔭 What’s Next

Completing AI-900 gave me the confidence to keep exploring Azure — next, I plan to:
- Try building small AI demos using **Azure Cognitive Services**.  
- Learn more about **Azure Machine Learning Studio**.  
- Eventually move toward a more advanced certification like **DP-100 (Azure Data Scientist Associate)** or **AI-102 (AI Engineer Associate)**.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Taking the AI-900 as my **first Azure certification** was a great experience.  
If you’re new to cloud or AI, I’d definitely recommend starting here — it gives you a broad understanding of both Cloud services as well as gentle introduction/refresher to AI and GenAI concepts.

If you’re preparing for AI-900, feel free to use my notes and reach out if you have questions — I’d love to hear how your journey goes!
