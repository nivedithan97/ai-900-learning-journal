# My AI-900 Journey: Notes, Reflections, and Getting Started with Azure

📘 *This repo is a small learning journal where I’m sharing my experience preparing for and completing the Microsoft AI-900 certification — along with my personal notes and takeaways from exploring Azure for the first time.*

---

I recently completed the **Microsoft AI-900: Azure AI Fundamentals** certification — and it’s been an exciting milestone in my learning journey! 🎉  

This was actually my first hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure, and I wanted to share my thoughts, lessons, and personal notes for anyone else who’s just starting out.

## 🌟 Why I Took the Exam

Even though I come from a technical background, I wanted to strengthen my understanding of how AI concepts translate into real-world cloud applications.  
AI-900 felt like a great way to bridge that gap — it’s beginner-friendly but still provides a solid grounding in core AI and ML principles, while showing how Azure makes these services accessible.

For me, it was also a nice refresher on foundational AI topics I’d come across before, but with a new perspective through the Azure lens.  
And since this was my first time actually working hands-on with Microsoft Azure, it felt like the perfect starting point to get comfortable with the platform and its AI ecosystem.

## 🧭 Preparation Path

Since this was my first time exploring Azure, I started with Microsoft Learn’s AI-900 modules, which I highly recommend for beginners.  

My prep plan looked something like this:
- Microsoft Learn → Followed the full AI Fundamentals learning path.  
- YouTube tutorials → I personally found John Savill's YouTube videos for AI-900 extremely helpful in consolidating what I’d learned from Microsoft Learn. He has two videos — one for non-GenAI content and another focused on GenAI. Most of the content in my mind map notes came from his videos.  
- Practice tests → There are tons of AI-900 practice tests on Udemy. I mainly practiced Nikolai Schuler’s tests under timed conditions. I also highly recommend taking the free Microsoft mock exam to get a feel for the real question format.  
- My own notes → I summarized everything into visual notes, which you can find [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG2Xz9etdY/ZjU1jb6y-3VB5odJCKycXQ/view?utm_content=DAG2Xz9etdY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h88bf57e872).  
These notes helped me retain the big ideas and understand how each Azure service fits into real-world AI solutions.

I spent around 2–3 weeks, studying a bit each evening, focusing more on understanding concepts than memorizing definitions. Putting it all into a mind map really helped reinforce my understanding.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

Here are some of my main learnings:
- AI on Azure is more approachable than I expected — tools like Cognitive Services abstract away a lot of complexity.  
- Responsible AI isn’t just a buzzword — it’s embedded in how Microsoft designs and governs its AI solutions.  
- Understanding use cases is just as important as learning the services themselves.  
- The exam is conceptual, not deeply technical, but you should know what each Azure AI service does and when to use it.

## 🧠 Exam Day & Experience

The exam itself was quite straightforward if you’ve gone through the Microsoft Learn materials.  

There were a few scenario-based questions asking which service you’d use in a particular situation (e.g., Computer Vision vs. Custom Vision).  
Time wasn’t an issue — I finished early and had time to review.  

My advice:
- Read questions carefully — some answers are very similar.  
- Don’t overthink it — focus on the purpose of each service.  
- Stay calm! It’s an entry-level exam designed for newcomers.

## 🔭 What’s Next

Completing AI-900 gave me the confidence to keep exploring Azure — next, I plan to:
- Try building small AI demos using Azure Cognitive Services.  
- Learn more about Azure Machine Learning Studio.  
- Eventually move toward a more advanced certification like DP-100 (Azure Data Scientist Associate) and/or AI-102 (AI Engineer Associate).

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Taking the AI-900 as my first Azure certification was a great experience.  
If you’re new to cloud or AI, I’d definitely recommend starting here — it gives you a broad understanding of both cloud services as well as a gentle introduction (or refresher) to AI and GenAI concepts.

If you’re preparing for AI-900, feel free to use my notes and reach out if you have questions — I’d love to hear how your journey goes!
